This is just the begging
To get this up and running. I'm using a usb microphone.
I'm not sure how else to do this except for using a usb microphone. 
I'm acutually using a usb web cam. So as long as it is usb I think it will work. 

I'm using python > 3.0.0
so go to the python.org and download python 

After you download python you need PyAudio 2.9 or greater. This is still in development so you cant 
just install it. You need to install PyAudio for 3.0 or greater. 

run command prompt with administrator privilages
pip3 install pyaudio 

I used the VS pip install method in VS, you might have to install pip. not sure.

Then you need pocketSphinx for python
pip3 install pocketsphinx 

again I just VS pip installation that is built into VS, so I'm not even sure you need to use pip3 

I hope this works...
